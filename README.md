Was originally made as an educational project for using OOP principles in Python. \
File **reader.py** has a class **Image** for checking the extention of the uploaded image file and reading text from it. \
File **design.py** has a class **PageDetails** for printing customized details and also default information about the page. \
**page.py** is basically the main file where class objects are instantiated and class methods are called.
